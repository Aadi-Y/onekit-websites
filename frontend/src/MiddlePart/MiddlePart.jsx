            <p>
              From using the referral code for an extra 20% discount to getting
              us to follow a new skin care routine, the influencers got us. Not
              just us, you too. These people are backed up by loyal audiences
              who relate themselves with them. So why still underestimate the
              power of the new age word-of-mouth marketing? Let onekit be the
              bridge between the brand and the influencer, so the influencer as
              well as the brand can skip the tedious process of outreach,
              building strategies, and running campaigns.

              Questions like what is the meaning of the brand, why does it
              exist, what is the market volume, how to win over competitors and
              hence forth must be addressed. Before vaguely coming up with
              solutions we at onekit do intense case studies and immense
              research to full-fill the problem of how the brand wants to be
              perceived and how the ideal customer perceives the brand.
